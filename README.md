# Indian_Railways_Announcement_System
_____________________________________

This is the Announcement System I am making for ITS. 

To run this announcement system, do the following:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open Command Prompt (on Windows) or Terminal (on Mac and Linux. Am I right?)
3. Type the following commands: (I assume that you have opened the command prompt in the root folder of this repo and installed `pipenv`)
    1. `pipenv shell` (for creating the virtual environment.)
    2. `pipenv install ` (for installing all dependencies.)
    3. `python main.py` (for running the system.)

The announcement is running now!

Congrats!

Enjoy!
